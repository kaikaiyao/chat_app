## Configuration

EasyChat allows you to configure your LLM API settings via the **Settings** panel on the right side of the GUI. Fill in your API details or import them via a JSON file, then click **Save**.

### Example JSON File for Import Settings

Below is an example JSON file for importing your settings. Save this as `settings.json` and use the import feature in the Settings panel.

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "api_key": "your-api-key-here",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "temperature": 0.6,
  "top_p": 0.7
}
```

---

## Local Data Storage

All chat history in EasyChat is stored locally as JSON files. These files are saved in the `data` directory located in the `backend` folder. Each conversation is stored in its own file, named using the conversation's unique ID (e.g., `backend/data/<conversation_id>.json`).  
If you need to review or back up your chat logs, simply navigate to the `backend/data` directory on your system. Note that deleting a conversation from the EasyChat interface will also remove its corresponding file from this directory.
